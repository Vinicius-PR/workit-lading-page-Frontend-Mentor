# Frontend Mentor - Workit landing page

![Design preview for the Workit landing page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools I want to build this landing page. I used just **HTML** and **CSS**.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


## What I learned

I already knew about the flex-box and I used it a lot during the build. One thing that I learned from this challente was the use of **@font-face** rule.

I have never used this rule before. Today I discovered how easy it is. When I wanted to use a different font, I used to go to Google Fonts and put the link inside the head tag, at *index.html* file.

Now I know that I can download a font that I like, put inside the files and use **@font-face** to put inside css.
